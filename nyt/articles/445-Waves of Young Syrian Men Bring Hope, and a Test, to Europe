The mass displacement of so many young men poses great challenges to countries like Syria, homeland to more than half of those fleeing: The exodus deprives them of a demographic vital to reconstruction and economic growth.

There are also great risks for Europe, which has long struggled to assimilate immigrants and could face the creation of a new underclass that taxes the public purse. Many also worry that pockets of radicalization could grow if the aspirations of the new arrivals end in isolation and poverty.

“We know on the positive side that migration can boost economies and trade and lead to cultural exchange,” said Lado Gvilava, the head of the International Organization for Migration in Turkey, the departure point for most migrants. “But if it is mismanaged, it becomes a problem for both the receiving states and the countries left behind.”

Aid groups say the chaotic nature of the human traffic has left them without a full picture of the current wave of people reaching Europe. The United Nations refugee agency says that just over half are Syrians, followed by smaller groups from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq and elsewhere. Sixty-nine percent are men, 13 percent women and 18 percent children.

The largest single group appears to be young men, open to adventure but woefully ill informed about what they are getting into. Among the dozens of them interviewed recently in Turkey and Greece, only a few spoke any languages other than their native tongue, and most knew little about the countries they hoped to make their new homes. Some were surprised to learn that beer and pork are prominent in German cuisine.

“Our only hope is in Europe,” said Mohammed Atiyya, 21, a Palestinian from Damascus who had been training as a metal worker when he was drafted into the Syrian Army.

After nearing the end of what was supposed to be a two-year stint, he realized he was more likely to end up dead than decommissioned, so he deserted, later fleeing to Europe by raft.

He is now in Hamburg, Germany.

United Nations officials report meeting with many educated Syrians, including engineers, civil servants and small-business owners, who were solidly middle class before the war, but have since lost their homes and businesses.

A minority arrive with clear plans.

“My destination is France because I speak French,” said Fayez, 27, a Syrian dentist who said he had fled Aleppo because he risked his life going to work every day.

After he was detained by rebels, he submitted an asylum application to France, but it was rejected, he said, so he now planned to sneak in, register as a refugee and continue his career.

“We didn’t flee because we didn’t have the money, but because of insecurity,” he said in Greece, giving only his first name to protect relatives in Syria.

The countries of Europe face a difficult task in integrating the migrants into their work force so they can contribute economically instead of adding to the social burden.

Many of the new arrivals lack transferable skills and speak no European languages. Even professionals like doctors and engineers are unlikely to have their foreign credentials immediately recognized.

To succeed, Europe must invest heavily in programs to teach migrants languages, pair skilled workers with jobs and help everyone else find training and work, said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, the president of the Migration Policy Institute Europe.

Countries like Germany and Sweden have organized economies and labor needs that could facilitate this, he said. But Austria has a small work force, and Spain, Italy and Greece have economic problems and high unemployment, leaving little room for migrants.

“This could lead to a serious set of troubles for Europe, politically and economically, in the next few years,” Mr. Papademetriou said.

Many worry that migrant populations that fail to integrate could become fertile ground for unrest or radicalization, especially if they find themselves under attack by right-wing elements.

And a terrorist attack linked to even a tiny group of migrants could change the situation for all. At present, there is little to stop jihadists from the Islamic State or other radical groups from covertly slipping in with other migrants.

The Greek authorities on Lesbos, where most migrants now arrive, have at times been so overwhelmed with newcomers that they suspended fingerprinting and photographing refugees to speed up registration, said Djamal Zamzoum of the United Nations refugee agency on the island.

Others arrive with no documents or lie about their origins, making them hard to identify, he said. And fleeing war traumatizes many migrants, further complicating their assimilation.

Mohammed Abdul-Haq, a Palestinian from Damascus, was working in a sweet shop when the Syrian government arrested him in a sweep aimed at dissidents, he said. During three and a half years in prison, he was hung by his wrists and beaten during interrogation.

Released in August, he rushed to Turkey to head for Europe with his wife and their 10-year-old daughter, but he had thought little about what he would do once he got there.

“I have no idea,” said Mr. Abdul-Haq, 38. “I just want to get there and be safe.”

How the outflow affects Syria will probably depend on how and when the civil war ends.

Many of those fleeing to Europe have recently left areas controlled by President Bashar al-Assad, saying that basic infrastructure was failing and that life had become dangerous. Some have deserted the army or are dodging service, deepening the personnel shortage of his army.

Scholars of human migration say that the longer conflicts last and the farther away refugees settle, the less likely they are to go home.

After the conflict in Bosnia, many refugees returned, if not necessarily to their home communities, which had been subjected to ethnic cleansing, said Laura Hammond, the head of the development studies department at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

Many refugees returned to Chechnya after the conflict there because they had settled nearby in other parts of Russia, where they did not feel welcome.

But even those who remain abroad often retain strong ties with their home countries, Ms. Hammond said, either by sending money to their relatives or by returning occasionally with capital and experience acquired abroad to invest and start businesses.

“We should think of these men as part of the work force who will eventually help rebuild the country,” she said of the men fleeing Syria. “They don’t think of themselves as permanently gone.”

But with the Syrian war in its fifth year and no end in sight, few of those heading for Europe plan to go back.

Waiting in a park in Turkey before catching a raft to Greece, Mohammed, 41, said the battle for Aleppo had chased his family from their home and destroyed the body shop where he had worked.

Now he was aiming to settle in Germany and bring his wife, their four children and his mother, he said, declining to give his last name because he feared for his family.

He would work wherever he could, he said, and he was carrying a book to teach himself German.

“The words are very heavy,” he said, unable to produce a phrase. He knew little more about his destination.

“It is a beautiful country, and the people are nice,” he said. “That’s what I have heard.”
