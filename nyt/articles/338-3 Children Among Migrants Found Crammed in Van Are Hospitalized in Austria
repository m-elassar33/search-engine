VIENNA â€” Three small children found crammed into a small van with 23 other migrants were hospitalized with severe dehydration in northern Austria, narrowly averting another fatal tragedy for refugees fleeing the Middle East and risking their lives with smugglers, the police said Saturday.

The police found the children around 4 a.m. Friday after a chase of a suspicious vehicle spotted near the Austrian-German border near Braunau.

The discovery came less than 24 hours after the Austrian police found 71 decomposing bodies in a truck southeast of Vienna.

The driver of the vehicle intercepted Friday initially ignored the police appeals to stop, said the police spokesman, David Furtner. Eventually, the driver stopped, and the police found the 26 refugees.

Five-year-old twin girls and a 6-year-old boy, all from Syria, were in life-threatening condition and taken immediately to the hospital in Braunau, Mr. Furtner said. Their conditions have since improved, he said.
