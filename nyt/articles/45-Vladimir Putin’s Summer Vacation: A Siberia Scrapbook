He took a fishing and mushroom-hunting trip to Siberia, where the Kremlin allowed photos to be taken of the president while in action mode (and at rest). Shirts were optional attire during much of his visit.

A fishing pole was an essential part of the luggage he took to a lake in the Tyva Republic in southern Siberia, where he stayed from Tuesday to Thursday.

While snorkeling is probably not high on the list of most tourists who plan a visit to Russia, Mr. Putin demonstrated that the country’s lakes, whose waters can be quite chilly even during the summer, do provide that option for the adventurous.

“It’s very sly and cautious,” the president said of his prey after getting out of the water, according to The Associated Press.

Hiking and kayaking were also on the agenda as were more placid pursuits, like picking mushrooms, including the ones above he is showing to Mr. Shoigu.

When he wasn’t going shirtless, Mr. Putin showed a wilderness-inspired fashion sense, which included a sprig in his coat pocket.
