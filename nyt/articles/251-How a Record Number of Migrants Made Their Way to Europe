LONDON — The number of migrants and refugees who have entered Europe by sea and land this year has passed the one million mark, a long-expected but symbolically significant capstone to a year in which displaced people flocked to the Continent.

The huge influx — the largest movement of people on the Continent since World War II — has strained the resources of Germany, which has been the ultimate destination for most of the migrants; prompted a right-wing backlash there and in much of Europe; and exposed the European Union’s inability to coordinate an effective response.

The Main Points of Entry

As of Monday, 1,005,504 people had reached Europe, more than four times the number in 2014, the International Organization for Migration announced on Tuesday.

Greece was by far the most popular point of entry, with more than 820,000 migrants arriving there.

Italy saw more than 150,000 come to its shores, and Bulgaria was the first European stop for almost 30,000 newcomers. More than 3,800 people arrived in Spain, while Cyprus and Malta saw a few hundred arrivals.

Most of the migrants were from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia — and, in particular, from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.
