Like Mr. Cheboub, many have undergone multiple operations already and face months or years of physical rehabilitation and disability — in addition to the acute psychological trauma of seeing friends, family and strangers killed before their eyes.

“It was like a war scenario,” said Dr. Philippe Juvin, the head of the emergency department at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in central Paris, who also worked as a medic in Afghanistan in 2008.

The guns the terrorists used to shoot civilians were originally designed for use by armies on a battlefield, he noted. Two types of Kalashnikov bullets were employed, one that fragments on impact, and one that “cavitates” in the body once it enters and is designed to bounce around internally before exiting.

“This was meant to cause maximum damage,” Dr. Juvin said.

Amid the mayhem that spread across Paris the night of Nov. 13, doctors performed nearly 300 operations to remove bullets from victims’ torsos, organs, arms, legs, necks and brains, as well as shrapnel from explosive belts that the attackers had detonated.

Within the first 24 hours, more than 35 surgical teams treated 76 people with life-threatening injuries, according to a chilling account published by French doctors in The Lancet, the London-based medical journal. Seven people died after being admitted to the Paris hospitals network, which typically sees only five gunshot patients a year.

By chance, on the morning of the attacks, Paris hospitals had performed a dry run of a so-called White Plan to manage just such a widespread emergency, unaware that the scenario would become all too real hours later.

Upon the attacks, medical officials immediately activated the plan, quickly moving thousands of nurses, doctors, anesthesiologists, orthopedists and psychologists into place and opening 200 operating rooms across the city.

Forty-five teams of emergency medical workers had the grim task of sorting through the survivors and the dead, and triaging victims.

Dr. Mathieu Raux, the head of the trauma unit at the Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Paris, was among those who sprang into action with colleagues.

Today, he said, the hospital’s doctors are still tending to a range of injuries, including two patients struck in the brain by Kalashnikov bullets. Many others are in physical rehabilitation to recover from broken bones, fractures, severed tendons or nerve damage, which in some cases will require three to five years of treatment.

In the meantime, several doctors said in interviews, Paris hospitals are fine-tuning the White Plan and preparing for another possible attack.

While most victims have been able to return home, a number of others remain in intensive care.

At the Georges Pompidou hospital, Laura Croix, 31, a musician who was in the crowd at the Bataclan, underwent seven operations after six bullets strafed her in the abdomen and chest, her mother, Danielle Croix, said in an interview.

Last week, Laura, who survived a brain tumor at 16, was taken out of an artificial coma and smiled for the first time. But her mother said it was not clear if she would be able to perform on stage as before. Her biggest concern was that Laura would suffer considerable psychological trauma from the horrors she witnessed.

The majority of the attack victims and their families, and a large number of medical personnel, are receiving psychological support for emotional trauma. Many will require treatment for years, said Fadi Zebouni, the chief psychologist at Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, who oversees a staff of 100 professionals.

“These people are completely astonished,” he said. “Their relatives are dead or seriously injured, or even in a coma. Even the people that were present at the Bataclan who were able to escape are saying that while they are not dead, they feel psychologically dead.”

Many express feelings of “survivor guilt,” questioning whether they did enough to help others as they fled.

Over time, Mr. Zebouni said, post-traumatic stress disorders may wind up being less widespread in Paris than in the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks in New York City, where nearly 2,800 people died.

Researchers found strong evidence that people who directly experienced or witnessed the Sept. 11 attacks had higher levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to an article summarizing numerous studies, published in The Lancet in 2011.

Those included people who suffered injuries, people who lived near the World Trade Center, rescue and recovery workers, and people whose spouses died in the attack.

At the same time, many people exposed to the attacks were not affected by PTSD, or had only short-term stress reactions. They demonstrated resilience and were able to adapt to the adversity they had experienced and continue on with their lives.

In his small hospital room, Mr. Cheboub, 27, was trying to do the same. He preferred to focus on the future and his recovery, rather than on how he was wounded.

“Still,” he said, “you can’t forget what happened.”

Mr. Cheboub, who runs a casual-chic fashion label, Maison Honoré Paris, was having a drink with a friend when armed men appeared at the cafe and opened fire. He was hit instantly by a bullet and fell to the ground, where he was shot twice more as the gunfire continued for one to two minutes.

Nineteen people were killed, and Mr. Cheboub also feared that he would die. “When bullets are flying, people are screaming, you see blood everywhere — it’s the apocalypse,” he said. “When they finally stopped shooting and shouted ‘Allahu akbar,’ I suddenly understood that it was a terrorist attack.”

The bullets had shattered a bone in his left arm and incapacitated his legs. Using his right hand, he managed to drag himself across the blood-soaked floor to his friend, who was lying on the ground. She stroked his hair to comfort him.

Medics eventually took them to a makeshift clinic in a nearby restaurant, where the two became separated. When Mr. Cheboub awoke in the hospital the next morning, he learned that his friend had died.

Now he is trying to face newfound uncertainty head-on. After two operations, he is scheduled for a third this week. Later, he will rotate into a long-term rehabilitation center, where he hopes to regain mobility in his arm and legs.

So determined is Mr. Cheboub that he asked medics on Friday to wheel him on a stretcher to the Invalides monument, to be present as President François Hollande paid homage to the victims. He thought Mr. Hollande might walk over and shake his hand, or say hello to the families. “But he never even came over to us,” he said.

Back in the hospital, doctors told him that a nerve in his right foot might have been destroyed, raising doubts about how mobile he will be in the future. He had almost no sensation in his left arm.

Nonetheless, Mr. Cheboub said, “life must go on.” He paused and smiled as his girlfriend clasped him by the hand. “I’m not going to let the terrorists stop me from living.”
