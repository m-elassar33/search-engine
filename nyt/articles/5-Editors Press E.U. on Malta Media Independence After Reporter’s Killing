Angered by the car-bomb killing of a Maltese investigative journalist last month, the editors of six European newspapers, the BBC and The New York Times asked the European Union on Thursday to examine Malta’s media independence and to remind the island nation of its obligations to guarantee a free press.

The journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, was known for her blog uncovering corruption in Malta, the European Union’s smallest member, and for having revealed its connections to offshore tax havens through the Panama Papers document leaks.

“The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia demonstrates the danger that journalists face in the pursuit of truth,” reads a letter from the news organizations. “It also demonstrates the fear that the corrupt and powerful have of being exposed.”

Ms. Caruana Galizia was killed when a bomb destroyed her car on Oct. 16 as she was driving in north-central Malta. Her last blog post, accusing the prime minister’s chief of staff of corruption, was published 30 minutes before she was killed.

Ms. Caruana Galizia’s death reverberated through Europe and beyond. Thousands of Malta citizens, outraged by what many regarded as a climate of impunity in their country, protested in the days after the killing. Press-freedom advocacy groups demanded accountability.

The letter to the European Union on Thursday signaled a more active stance by leading news organizations and broadened the demand to include a review of Malta’s media independence. It cited previous concerns raised by the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, about the extensive media ownership by political parties in Malta and a lack of safeguards for editorial independence in the country.
