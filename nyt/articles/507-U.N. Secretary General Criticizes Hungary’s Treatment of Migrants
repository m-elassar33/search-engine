In reality, the five permanent members of the Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — decide, and usually behind closed doors. This year, the General Assembly is calling on candidates to present their résumés and ideas before the broader membership in informal sessions. Though in the end, nothing compels the council not to do what they’ve always done: present the General Assembly with one name to rubber-stamp.
