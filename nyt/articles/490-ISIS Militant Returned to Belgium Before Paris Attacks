LONDON — Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Islamic State militant who the authorities say helped plan the Paris terrorist attacks that killed 130 people, traveled widely across Europe in the lead-up to the attacks.

In recent weeks, investigators have revealed that Mr. Abaaoud, a Belgian citizen who had traveled to Syria to fight for the Islamic State, drove a rental car to Budapest to pick up two friends and even took a ferry to Britain, where he snapped photographs of London landmarks on his cellphone.

On Wednesday, officials in Belgium confirmed what had long been suspected: Mr. Abaaoud returned to his native Belgium, and was there about two months before the attacks on Nov. 13 — despite an international arrest warrant that Belgian authorities issued after they foiled a terrorist plot that Mr. Abaaoud is believed to have organized last January, in the eastern city of Verviers.

The disclosure added to the picture of failures across multiple countries to apprehend Mr. Abaaoud, 26, who died in a raid by French police in St.-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris, on Nov. 18.

The federal prosecutor’s office in Brussels said on Wednesday that it had identified three residences — in essence, safe houses — that were used to prepare for the attacks: an apartment in the Schaerbeek district of Brussels; an apartment in the city of Charleroi, about 40 miles south of Brussels; and a house in Auvelais, a town just east of Charleroi.
