Nearly 400,000 refugees and migrants fleeing war and deprivation have arrived in Greece by crossing the Mediterranean Sea this year, the United Nations said Friday in a new accounting of the swelling volumes of people seeking sanctuary in Europe. The arrivals in Greece underscored its new role as the top point of entry to Europe and were more than three times the 131,000 who reached Italy, the No. 2 sea-route destination, so far in 2015. The updated figures, tallied by the United Nations refugee agency, showed that 168,000 people crossed the Mediterranean in September, the highest monthly figure ever recorded and almost five times the volume of a year earlier.
