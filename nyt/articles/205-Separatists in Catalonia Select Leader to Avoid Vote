MADRID — The Catalan separatist parties on Saturday reached an 11th-hour agreement to replace the leader of the region, Artur Mas, and avoid new elections that risked derailing Catalonia’s push to secede from the rest of Spain.

Under the accord, Mr. Mas will step aside and be replaced by Carles Puigdemont, who is the mayor of the Catalan city of Girona. The agreement ends more than three months of feuding among separatist parties over who should lead the next regional government.

Mr. Mas on Saturday described his decision as “painful” and emphasized that he planned to remain in politics, even if he was no longer in charge of the regional government and its secessionist movement. At a news conference, he also offered words of praise for his party colleague, Mr. Puigdemont, saying, “He understands very clearly the country project, knows that Catalonia is a nation and has the right to decide and that it’s appropriate for Catalonia to use the right to self-determination in order to have its own state.”

Mr. Mas had failed to convince the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy party — known by its Catalan acronym, CUP — to allow him to stay in office after regional parliamentary elections on Sept. 27 in which a separatist coalition of parties won, but not with enough seats to form a government without support from the CUP.

The CUP, however, insisted that it could never agree to another Catalan government led by Mr. Mas. It faults Mr. Mas for imposing austerity cuts, as well as for failing to acknowledge corruption within his Convergence Party. Mr. Mas would have been forced to convene new elections if no deal had been struck by Sunday.
