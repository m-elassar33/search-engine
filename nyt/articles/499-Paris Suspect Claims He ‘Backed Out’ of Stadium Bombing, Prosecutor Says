BRUSSELS — Salah Abdeslam, believed to be the only direct participant in the November attacks in Paris who is still alive, told investigators on Saturday after being captured a day earlier that he wanted to detonate his suicide vest at the Stade de France soccer stadium on the night of the attacks but “backed out,” said the lead terrorism prosecutor in France.

Three of the attackers detonated their vests there, but killed just one person and themselves on Nov. 13 during a match between France and Germany.

The prosecutor, François Molins, warned against putting too much stock in anything Mr. Abdeslam said at such an early stage. “These first statements leave unanswered a whole series of questions that Salah Abdeslam will have to answer,” he said.

At a hearing before a judge in Belgium on Saturday, Mr. Abdeslam made it clear that he would fight extradition to France, said his lawyer, Sven Mary.

Mr. Mary spoke to journalists after he and Mr. Abdeslam met with a Belgian magistrate who was to decide whether to issue a formal arrest warrant against Mr. Abdeslam, who is accused of playing a key role in the Nov. 13 attacks on a concert, cafes and a stadium that killed 130 people.

Later Saturday, the magistrate issued the warrant, the federal prosecutor’s office said.

Mr. Abdeslam was captured with another person suspected of being an accomplice, and both were taken to a Brussels hospital. They were discharged early Saturday, Yvan Mayeur, the Brussels mayor, said on Twitter.

Mr. Abdeslam, a French citizen, is subject to a European arrest warrant issued by France. His seizure in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek after he spent four months on the run brought relief to people who had seen his wanted poster all over two countries for months.
