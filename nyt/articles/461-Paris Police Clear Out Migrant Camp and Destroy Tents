PARIS — The French police evacuated hundreds of migrants from a camp in Paris early Tuesday in the latest attempt to control a growing population of migrants arriving on European shores after crossing the Mediterranean Sea.

Officials and humanitarian associations supervising the operation said the 380 migrants, most from East African countries like Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia, had been told to gather their belongings and then led to buses that took them away. Immediately after, the authorities bulldozed through the tents.

Some of the migrants, including women and children, had spent months in the camp, where hundreds of tents took root under an elevated Métro line in north central Paris. The camp was near a major rail station and not far from the Sacré-Coeur basilica, a popular tourist attraction.

Bruno Morel, the general manager of Emmaüs Solidarité, an association that provided aid for the migrants, said that the camp had taken shape last fall, and that the number of migrants had swelled. Mr. Morel, who oversaw the evacuation, said living conditions in the camp were “catastrophic.”

“When nearly 400 people are living in a public area, in the cold, sleeping on the ground and curling up in makeshift tents without water or electricity, these aren’t even the most basic living conditions,” Mr. Morel said in a telephone interview.

The camp was one of many that have been popping up throughout Europe. Many of the migrants are headed north, where the economy is stronger and, in some cases, the asylum rules less stringent.
