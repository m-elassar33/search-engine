GENEVA — Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia have started screening migrants and refugees on the basis of nationality and allowing entry only to those from Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria, the United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday.

Serbia sent 200 people who were not from those three countries back to Macedonia on Tuesday night, William Spindler, a spokesman for the refugee agency, said in an interview.

Some of those who were sent back were admitted to a refugee reception post in Tabanovce, Macedonia, but about 100 were refused entry and are now stranded in the open, he said.

The Red Cross was allowed to distribute blankets, but the refugee agency has not been able to gain access and is concerned for the migrants’ situation, Mr. Spindler said.

“Cold weather is forecast for the weekend, and we are appealing to authorities to address their situation as soon as possible,” he added.
