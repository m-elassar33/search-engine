Given two minutes to air her views on Germany’s response to the refugee crisis in Europe during a newscast on Wednesday night, Anja Reschke, a respected broadcaster, blamed a recent spate of what she called “hateful Internet tirades” for inciting real-world violence against foreigners, and she called on the public to speak up in favor of “decency.”

“If I now publicly say, ‘I think Germany should take in economic refugees,’ what do you think would happen?” Ms. Reschke asked at the start of her commentary. “It is just an opinion that can be expressed and it would be good if there would be a factual discussion of the issue. But that would not happen. I would receive a flood of hateful comments: ‘Shoot them.’ ‘How many more will we welcome?’ ‘They should get lost.’ ‘They should be burned’ and the like.”

“Until recently,” she continued, such commentators on social media platforms like Facebook “hid behind pseudonyms, but now these comments are increasingly being published under their writers’ real names.”

“Apparently it’s no longer embarrassing — on the contrary, phrases like ‘filthy vermin should drown in the sea,’ garner praise and lot of likes,” she said. “If until then you had been just an insignificant racist, you suddenly feel great.”

Ms. Reschke added that “these are not just words — arson attacks on refugee centers are a reality.”
