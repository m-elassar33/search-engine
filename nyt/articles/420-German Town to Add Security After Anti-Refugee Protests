FRANKFURT — The German police planned to step up security measures in a small town outside Dresden on Sunday after two nights of sometimes violent demonstrations by right-wing extremists near a temporary shelter for refugees.

Although the situation appeared to have calmed, the outcry earlier in the weekend illustrated the challenges that the authorities face as Germany absorbs an influx of people fleeing civil war in Syria, as well as other troubled places like Afghanistan and North Africa. Almost 83,000 refugees arrived in Germany last month, and the government estimates that by the end of the year, 800,000 people will have come seeking asylum.

The Dresden police said that about 250 people, some holding bottles and waving flags associated with right-wing groups, demonstrated late Saturday and early Sunday near a former building supply outlet in Heidenau, a town of about 16,000 people on the Elbe River south of Dresden. The building, which resembles a warehouse, is being used as temporary housing for about 600 asylum seekers, with more arriving daily.

Another 250 counterdemonstrators faced the right-wing groups, according to the police, who said they were able to keep the two groups apart. Two police officers were injured, considerably fewer than on Friday night, when more than 30 were injured. One person was arrested, the police said.

German television showed the protesters throwing rocks and beer bottles at police officers in riot gear and knocking down police barricades. Some chanted, “Wir sind das Volk,” or “We are the people,” a slogan associated with the downfall of the East German regime in 1989 that has been appropriated by right-wing groups.
