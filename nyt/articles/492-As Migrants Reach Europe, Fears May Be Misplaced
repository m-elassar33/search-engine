MUNICH — “We can’t welcome everybody,” a Bavarian-based newspaper wrote recently. Crowding thousands of people from different cultures into tents and hoping that they follow German customs was simply irresponsible. There were 1,000 criminal acts, 2,000 police interventions and 3,000 injuries over a two-week period alone. All this self-congratulatory talk of hospitality had to stop.

“Ban the Oktoberfest!” demanded the paper, The Süddeutsche Zeitung.

Of course, the image for most readers right up until the punch line was likely not one of drunken Americans and Australians spoiling for a fight during Bavaria’s annual beer festival, but of migrants crammed into makeshift shelters across the country.

Europe is witnessing a curious moment: In an age when one cannot pass through airport security with a bottle of water, tens of thousands arrive every day with little or no screening.

As the number of migrants continues to rise, so do fears of unrest, crime and even Islamic State fighters hiding in the continuing stream of people.

About 120 miles northeast of Munich’s festivities, in a donated tent near the Austrian border, Stephan Wittenzellner of the federal police was watching one recent evening as hundreds of fresh arrivals lined up to board buses that would take them to destinations across Bavaria. There were women and children but mostly young men.

Was he worried one of them might be a potential militant?

“I would be lying if I said no,” said Mr. Wittenzellner.
