The dissident artist and activist Ai Weiwei said on Wednesday that he would close his current exhibition at the Faurschou Foundation in Copenhagen in protest of a new law allowing Denmark to confiscate refugees’ valuables to help pay for their stay in the country.

The law, which was Parliament approved on Tuesday, requires refugees to hand over any assets worth over 10,000 kroner, or about $1,450, although exceptions would be made for items with sentimental value, like wedding rings.

Mr. Ai made the announcement on Instagram, and the Faurschou, a contemporary art gallery, confirmed on both its Instagram account and its Facebook page that the exhibition, “Ruptures,” would close ahead of schedule.

In a statement on Instagram using language identical to that of Mr. Ai’s post, the museum said that its owner, Jens Faurschou, backed the artist’s decision. It cited regrets over the Danish Parliament’s decision “to be in the forefront of symbolic and inhuman politics of todays biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe and the Middle East, instead of being in the forefront of a respectful European solution to solve the acute humanitarian crisis.”

Opponents have criticized the Danish law as divisive, and they say it will diminish the country’s reputation for tolerance and potentially encourage xenophobia.

The show, which opened in spring 2015, had been scheduled to run through April 15.

In the past month, Mr. Ai’s Instagram account has focused on documenting refugees arriving on the shores of the Greek island of Lesbos.
