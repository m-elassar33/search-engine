Responding to a growing international crisis, thousands of Iceland’s residents have taken to social media to put pressure on their government to take in more migrants.

The island nation has already said it will take in 50 migrants, but officials said on Tuesday that the country would consider raising that number.

A newly formed Facebook group, Syria is Calling, which has more than 13,000 members, is urging the government to take in 5,000.

“The idea is to show the government that there exists a will to receive even more refugees from Syria than the 50 that have already been discussed. We want to push the government — show them that we can do better, and do so immediately!” a group post said in English and Icelandic.

The group said some of its members have offered to open their houses to migrants and others have volunteered to donate money, clothes, furniture and other items, or to help the new arrivals assimilate.

The Facebook page also said: “Refugees are our future spouses, best friends, our next soul mate, the drummer in our children’s band, our next colleague, Miss Iceland 2022, the carpenter who finally fixes our bathroom, the chef in the cafeteria, the fireman, the hacker and the television host. People who we’ll never be able to say to: ‘Your life is worth less than mine.’
