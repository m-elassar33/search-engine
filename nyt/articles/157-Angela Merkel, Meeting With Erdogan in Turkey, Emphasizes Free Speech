ANKARA, Turkey — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany emphasized the importance of freedom of opinion in talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on Thursday, during a visit meant to help improve frayed ties between the two NATO allies.

In her first trip to Ankara since a failed military coup in Turkey in July, Ms. Merkel said she had agreed with Mr. Erdogan on the need for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K.

Germany and Turkey have been at odds over Ankara’s crackdown on dissidents since the abortive July 15 coup, as well as Turkish allegations, rejected by Berlin, that Germany is harboring Kurdish and far-left militants.

“In such a time of profound political upheaval, everything must be done to continue to protect the separation of powers and, above all, freedom of opinion and the diversity of society,” Ms. Merkel said at a news conference when asked about concerns over proposed constitutional changes that would strengthen Mr. Erdogan’s powers. She added that she had also raised the issue of press freedom.

“Opposition is part of democracy,” Ms. Merkel said.

Turkey’s allies, including Germany, fear that Mr. Erdogan is using the coup attempt as a pretext to curtail dissent, and Mr. Erdogan’s opponents fear that his planned constitutional changes will lead to an authoritarian state.
