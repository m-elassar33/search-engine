PARIS — In a highly critical report made public on Tuesday, police inspectors detailed a string of “objective failures” by French security and intelligence services regarding Mohammed Merah, the self-proclaimed jihadist who shot and killed seven people in southern France in March.

Written by the General Inspectorate of the National Police, the report faulted the French police and domestic intelligence agencies as failing to coordinate their work.

After tracking Mr. Merah, 23, for several years, they halted their surveillance just months before the killings for reasons that remain unclear. Mr. Merah, who said he had joined Al Qaeda and trained with jihadist fighters in Pakistan, was killed in a shootout with the police.

At the time of the killings, French officials presented him as a “lone wolf” whose radical profile had escaped the attention of authorities. But the report released Tuesday contradicted that claim, and described failures to share information or to act promptly on inquiries as well as an ineffectual system of screening air travelers that allowed Mr. Merah to fly to Pakistan in August 2011 without the authorities being alerted.

Though he had been “the object of the attention of intelligence services” since 2006, a 2010 legal complaint against Mr. Merah, who had reportedly shown a young boy a video of beheadings in Afghanistan, was never brought to the attention of the country’s domestic intelligence agency, the report said.
