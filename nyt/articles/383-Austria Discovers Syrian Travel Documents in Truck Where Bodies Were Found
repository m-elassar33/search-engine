VIENNA â€” The law enforcement authorities in Germany indicated on Tuesday that two suspects held in Hungary in connection with the deaths of 71 people found in a truck near Vienna on Thursday had been known to them for earlier crimes, including the smuggling of migrants to Bavaria just over a month ago.

The revelations about the two suspects, a Bulgarian and an Afghan, came as investigators in Austria, who are combing the truck in which the migrants were discovered, said that they had found about a dozen Syrian travel documents in the vehicle, and that they were checking if they were genuine.

A man referred to in the German news media as Metodi G., 29 years old and born in Lom, Bulgaria, is thought to be one of two people who fled a truck on a highway in Bavaria on July 25 after being chased by the police.

The police later found 38 people, mostly Afghan migrants, crammed into the truck. But they failed to catch the two men, said Peter Wiesenberger, a public prosecutor in the Bavarian district of Deggendorf, close to the border with Austria.

The German website Spiegel Online was first to name Metodi G., and to partially identify three other suspects in the inquiry: Samsooryamal L., 28, an Afghan; and two men with Bulgarian names, Tsvetan T., said to be 32, and Kassim S., 50.
