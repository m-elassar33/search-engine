Three men armed with knives and driving a white van unleashed a terrorist attack in London on Saturday night. Here is what is known so far.

What We Know

• Seven people were killed and dozens injured in the attack on Saturday near the London Bridge and Borough Market areas of London.

• A Canadian, Chrissy Archibald, was among those killed in the attack, the premier of British Columbia, Christy Clark, confirmed. Ms. Archibald, 30, was from the province.

• Another person killed was a French citizen, the French Embassy in the United Kingdom announced. An additional seven French citizens were injured, and one was missing, the embassy said.



• On Sunday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq news service, saying that it was carried out by “a detachment of Islamic State fighters.”

• The police said in a statement that the three male suspects, who were later found to be wearing fake explosive vests, were shot and killed within eight minutes of the first reports of an incident on London Bridge.

• On Sunday, the Metropolitan Police Service said that officers had arrested 12 people — seven women and five men — in the East London neighborhood of Barking. Their ages range from 17 to 60; a 55-year-old man was later released. More raids were conducted early Monday in Barking and Newham, also in East London, and “a number” of people were being questioned.

• Britain’s leader, Theresa May, vowed a sweeping review of the nation’s counterterrorism strategy.

• In the attack, the men drove a vehicle onto the sidewalk on London Bridge, striking several pedestrians, around 10 p.m. local time, according the Metropolitan Police Service.

• The police said the vehicle left London Bridge and drove to nearby Borough Market, where the attackers left the vehicle and began stabbing people, including an on-duty British Transport Police officer who was responding to the scene at London Bridge. The police said his injuries were serious, but not life-threatening.

• Mayor Sadiq Khan of London called the attacks “a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners and visitors to our city enjoying their Saturday night.”

• The police urged people to evacuate the area or shelter in place while they responded to the attacks. Video of police officers instructing restaurant patrons to hide under their tables spread widely online and on news channels.

• The London Ambulance Service said in a statement that it had transported 48 patients to five hospitals across the city. Twenty-one people remained in critical condition on Sunday.

Video

• London Bridge and the nearby railway station were shut down after the attack. The station was reopened in time for Monday morning rush hour, but the bridge remained closed to pedestrians. The police asked people to avoid the areas around London Bridge and Borough Market.

• London police said they also responded to a stabbing near Vauxhall, an area some distance from London Bridge and Borough Market. They said it was believed to be unrelated to the terrorist attacks.

• Mrs. May said these attacks were not related to the suicide bombing in Manchester late last month, which killed 23 people, including the bomber.

• President Trump sent out multiple messages on Twitter on Sunday, for which others criticized him.

On Saturday, he had expressed the United States’ support for Britain, while in another post he appeared to leverage the incident as evidence for the need for his so-called targeted travel ban.

What We Don’t Know

• The identities of the three dead attackers have not been publicly released.

• We do not know the identities of all the people killed in the attack.

• We do not know what weapons were used in these attacks, though there are reports of at least one man with a knife.
