MOSCOW — Talks are underway to arrange a second meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Trump on the sidelines of an Asian economic summit meeting next week in Vietnam, the Kremlin said on Friday.

“It is indeed being discussed,” Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, told reporters on Friday. “It is hard to overestimate the importance and significance of any contact between the president of Russia and the United States for all international matters.”

The meeting would take place while the two leaders were attending the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Danang, Vietnam.

Any meeting would come amid continued tensions between the two countries, with Mr. Trump under pressure in Washington for seemingly dragging his feet on implementing new sanctions against Russia over accusations that it meddled in the 2016 American presidential election.

Since their first meeting in Hamburg, Germany, in July, relations have only deteriorated further. After the new sanctions passed Congress, Mr. Putin ordered the United States to cut hundreds of mostly local staffers from its diplomatic missions in Russia. The United States has pressured two Russian-government news organizations to register as foreign agents.
