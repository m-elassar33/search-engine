Members of the rock band Eagles of Death Metal returned on Tuesday to the Bataclan concert hall in Paris for the first time since their performance on Nov. 13, when gunmen stormed the building and killed 90 people.

The American band spent about 10 minutes outside the concert hall in a heavy rain, laying flowers at a makeshift memorial site and reading tributes to the dead.

Television crews and news photographers had waited for hours for the band, whose possible return to Paris to accompany the Irish band U2 in concert had been rumored. Spectators clapped and cheered when vehicles bearing members of the American band arrived.

Although the musicians survived the assault, part of a series of coordinated attacks in and around Paris for which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility, the band’s merchandise manager, Nick Alexander, was killed.

Eagles of Death Metal joined U2 onstage Monday night at the end of their performance at the AccorHotels Arena, a few miles from the Bataclan. U2 had postponed shows on Nov. 14 and 15 in Paris, citing France’s nationwide state of emergency.
