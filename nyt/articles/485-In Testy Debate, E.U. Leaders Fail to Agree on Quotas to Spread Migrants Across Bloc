Hundreds of migrants were camped out in recent weeks at a crossing between Italy and France, after French border officials denied them entry, and officials at the French port of Calais struggled once again this week to prevent surges of migrants from smuggling onto trucks bound for Britain that use the tunnel crossing the English Channel.

Even so, just hours after finance ministers representing 19 countries that use the euro again failed to break the deadlock between Greece and its creditors, European Union leaders killed proposals that would have forced each country to take a certain number of asylum seekers, opting for a voluntary program instead.

A final statement adopted Friday committed all 28 member states to “agree by consensus by the end of July” on how to distribute across Europe the 40,000 people now in Italy and Greece who are “in clear need of international protection.”

It described this as a “temporary and exceptional” measure.

Leaders have found broad consensus on taking stronger measures on interdiction, endorsing a stalled military operation “to tackle the traffickers and smugglers in accordance with international law,” and reinforcing controls on Europe’s external borders “to better contain the growing flows of illegal migration.”

The most dangerous route taken by migrants is across the central Mediterranean from Libya and other parts of North Africa. Flows there increased by 29 percent over April, according to Frontex, a European agency that helps patrol the bloc’s outer borders.

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country supported the mandatory quota system, voiced alarm Friday over the migrant crisis created by a flood of people fleeing conflict and desperate poverty in the Middle East and Africa.

“With the migration question, we are facing the biggest challenge for the European Union that I have seen during my term in office,” Ms. Merkel said.

There are far fewer migrants in Europe than in Turkey and Lebanon, which have taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees. Europe’s halting and cantankerous response to the migrants’ plight has dismayed United Nations officials and advocacy groups for immigrants.

“There’s no question that more is going to have to be done,” said Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency. “We are in the thick of the biggest forced displacement crisis of our era. We need answers that are commensurate with that.”

He added: “What we think is important is that there’s a collective response. These approaches of going it alone are no answer to asylum problems.”

The issue of migrants, which set off violent racist protests last weekend in Slovakia and has helped fuel extremist political groups across Europe, has laid bare a fundamental and explosive tension at the heart of the so-called European Project — a six-decade push for greater integration that aims for “ever closer union” but leaves intact the sovereign power of individual states on key issues like immigration.

Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, a research group in Brussels, said Europe was caught in a “halfway house,” torn between a commitment to a Europe without border controls for Europeans and individual countries’ determination to control their own frontiers and manage their own national asylum systems.

“Everyone now recognizes that the status quo is unworkable, but here are 28 different views on what to do about it,” Ms. Collett said. She added that there was an increased “political will” to deal with the migrant crisis, but “this will travels in many different directions.”

Since the start of the year, according to Frontex, about 153,000 migrants tried to enter Europe, a 149 percent increase over the same period last year. Many of them landed in Italy and Greece after dangerous trips across the Mediterranean from North Africa, a journey that has cost the lives of more than 1,800 people so far in 2015.

In recent months, however, there has also been a surge of migrants along land routes through the Balkans to Hungary, which detected more than 50,000 migrants from January to the end of May, an increase of 880 percent over the same period last year.

Hungary has nonetheless been one of the strongest critics of attempts to forge a united response, with its prime minister, Victor Orban, declaring recently, “I don’t believe in a European solution.” Instead, he wants Hungary to build a 13-foot-high fence along its border with Serbia, which is not a member of the European Union but is a major transit route for migrants.

In an effort to develop a unified response to the crisis, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm in Brussels, last month announced a plan for mandatory quotas that would force individual states to accept migrants currently in Italy and Greece. But this immediately met with fierce hostility, notably in Eastern and Central Europe, where leaders denounced the scheme as a violation of their sovereignty.

During the talks, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy protested that a nonbinding pledge to take in migrants would achieve nothing.

“If this is your idea of Europe, you can keep it,” Mr. Renzi told fellow leaders, according to Italian news reports. “Either there’s solidarity or we are wasting time.”

A pilot project in 2011 aimed at helping lift the burden on Malta, a Mediterranean nation that has been flooded with asylum seekers, was based on voluntary pledges to take in migrants from other European states. It has been widely characterized as a failure.

President François Hollande of France acknowledged at a news conference early Friday that discussions had been “long and introduced several moments of tension.” But officials insisted that even without mandatory quotas, Europe would manage to relocate 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece in the next two years. About 20,000 people sheltered in camps outside Europe would also be accommodated within the European Union, they said.

Mr. Edwards, the United Nations refugee spokesman, said Europe needed to do more than take in more migrants. It also needs to help address the root causes of migrant flows, tackle trafficking networks and improve a system under which asylum seekers are processed in the country in which they arrive.

European foreign ministers on Monday approved a naval operation to halt the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean, but this will be limited to intelligence gathering as efforts to get authorization from the United Nations for military action to disrupt smuggling rings have so far failed.

The plan for a military response has also run into obstacles from Libya’s internationally recognized government, which, despite having only tenuous control of parts of the country, has said it could not tolerate any European violations of its sovereignty.
