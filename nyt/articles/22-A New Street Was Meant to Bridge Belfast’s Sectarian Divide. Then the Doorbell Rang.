For several days afterward, those who fled were forced to stay in a different friend’s house each night, said the cook, who asked that he and his fiancée not be named because he felt their lives were still in danger.

This kind of intimidation is not new in Northern Ireland, nor does it appear to be on the rise. Around 30 people have declared themselves homeless for similar reasons each year for the past half-decade, according to statistics provided by the Northern Irish government, and this year’s figure of 33 is no departure from that trend.

But the recent episodes at Cantrell Close have made headlines in Northern Ireland because they occurred in a place that was intended to be a foundation stone for a post-sectarian society. It has also raised concerns about certain politicians’ commitment to the process of integration, and about the ability of the Northern Irish police to curb the influence of sectarian paramilitary groups.

“This is a very good illustration of a much deeper problem,” said Stephen Farry, a lawmaker from the Alliance Party, which tries to bridge the divides between the province’s Unionists and nationalist communities. “Northern Ireland is not yet a peaceful society. We have ongoing coercive control by paramilitary structures at a local level across many communities.”

A recent stroll down Cantrell Close, a tiny T-shaped cul-de-sac, did not make this instantly obvious. At first sight, it was a picture of prim, docile suburbia: 41 two-story homes, each with a tidy lawn and a garden fence, lined a quiet road with a shiny bike rack at one end and a speed bump at the other. The tensions became apparent only when you looked toward the sky.

Flying from some of the lampposts were the flags of the Ulster Volunteer Force, or U.V.F., a banned terrorist group that killed more than 400 people during the Northern Irish Troubles, mostly targeting Catholics and Irish nationalists, or those opposed to Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom.

No faction has claimed responsibility, but the police believe that the threats came from people purporting to be part of the U.V.F. Two men have been questioned in connection to the crime, on suspicion of membership in the group.

The East Belfast Community Initiative, which says it mediates on behalf of former U.V.F. combatants, said the U.V.F. was not involved. Cantrell Close, meanwhile, is just one of many streets in East Belfast lined with the group’s flags.

On Cantrell Close itself, there appears to be an informal omertà in place. Of those who answered their doors on a recent afternoon, none would discuss the threats to their former neighbors.

One man even claimed he knew nothing at all about the situation, his mouth curling into a faint smile.

Some outside the neighborhood have been more outspoken, however, about a culture of impunity that they believe encouraged whoever made the threats.

Before moving in, residents of Cantrell Close signed pledges against the display of controversial flags. The government also says it is illegal to fly the flags of terrorist groups.

Yet when the U.V.F. flags suddenly appeared in June, no action was taken either to find the perpetrators or to remove them, creating the impression that sectarianism would be tolerated even at such a symbolic housing development.

“The police, who you’d expect to lead, didn’t,” said Mairtin O Muilleoir, a lawmaker from Sinn Fein, an Irish nationalist party. “And the gangs were emboldened.”

Local unionist politicians were also perceived to take too weak a stance back in June.

“I’ll always be cautious about causation and correlation,” said Cillian McGrattan, a politics professor at Ulster University. But the reaction of politicians from the Democratic Unionist Party, or D.U.P., to sectarian episodes during the summer, including the Cantrell Close issue, “really left a lot to be desired,” he added.

Asked for comment, Emma Little-Pengelly, one of the party lawmakers facing criticism, said she had been clear in June about her opposition to paramilitary flags. She and a D.U.P. colleague also issued an immediate condemnation of last month’s threats to Catholic residents.

Belfast’s top policeman meanwhile suggested that the flags had not been deemed problematic enough to justify their removal back in June.

“The reality is that while we understand the public’s frustration in this matter, police will only act to remove flags if there are substantial risks to public safety,” Chief Superintendent Chris Noble said in an emailed statement.

(The flags were taken down only several days after the threats were made.)

For the young cook and his fiancée, these explanations mean little. They feel frustrated at the authorities for doing nothing in the first place to remove the flags, which they said were clearly intimidating. They feel abandoned by the police for failing, once the threats were made, to provide a permanent presence on the street.

And they fault the housing authorities for failing to quickly find them alternative accommodations — and for assuring them that the street was safe to move to.

The cook’s fiancée, a 20-year-old waitress, said officials should have recognized her vulnerability as a young mother with a newborn in tow before encouraging her to move in.

Politicians like Mr. O Muilleoir hope the episodes at Cantrell Close will not derail plans for more integrated housing projects. “In Europe in 2017, we either let an armed gang dictate policy,” he said, “or we step things up.”

But for the targeted families themselves, the integration dream is over. From now on, the cook said, his family would stick to neighborhoods with a Catholic majority.
