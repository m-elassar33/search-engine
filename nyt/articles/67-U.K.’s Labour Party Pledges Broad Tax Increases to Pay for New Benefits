Earnings of more than £80,000 would be taxed at 45 percent, while those of over £123,000, or $159,000, would face a 50 percent rate. Companies would pay a 2.5 percent tax on salaries paid above £330,000 and 5 percent on those above £500,000, about $645,000. And the corporate tax rate would rise to 26 percent by 2020 from 19 percent.

Those increases aimed to cover $62.7 billion in spending pledges and underlined the ideological shift Labour has made since the Blair years, when one of the prime minister’s closest aides, Peter Mandelson, said that Labour was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes.”

On Tuesday, Labour’s current, leftist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, brought back a Blair-era campaign slogan — “For the many, not the few” — but struck a markedly different tone.

Britain, Mr. Corbyn said at his manifesto announcement at the University of Bradford, had been “run for the rich, the elite and the vested interests,” adding: “They have benefited from tax cuts and bumper salaries while millions have struggled.”

“We are asking the better-off and the big corporations to pay a little bit more, and, of course, to stop dodging their tax obligations in the first place,” he added.

His stance is a gamble because the tax threshold of £80,000 catches many members of Britain’s professional classes who, whatever the statistics say, do not consider themselves rich, and even more voters who aspire to earn that sum. In London, where housing costs are very high, such salaries do not finance lavish lifestyles.

Critics also complained that some of the cost of nationalizations had not been taken into account. At the same time, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a research organization, said that the proposed income tax changes would affect 1.3 million Britons, but that many of those might take various measures to minimize their taxable income, reducing the proceeds for the government.

“Because the extent of those kinds of responses is very uncertain, the amount of extra revenue these higher tax rates would raise is also very uncertain,” wrote Robert Joyce, an associate director at the institute.

But the institute estimated that those earning between £80,000 and £100,000 a year would pay from nothing to £1,000 a year extra.

David Gauke of the Conservative Party, who is chief secretary to the Treasury, attacked the broader plan. “It’s clear that proposal after proposal in this manifesto will mean more borrowing and debt: from promises on benefits, to promises on prison guards, to promises on nationalizing the water network,” he said in a statement.
