ATHENS — The bodies of four children, one of them a baby, were among those of seven migrants recovered off the Greek island of Lesbos on Thursday after their wooden boat collided with a Greek Coast Guard vessel that was on a rescue operation, a Greek Shipping Ministry official said.

The collision occurred shortly after 11 a.m. as the boat, sailing from Turkey, approached the island’s northern coast, the official said.

“It’s not clear exactly what happened,” the official said. “Somehow their boat hit the back of ours.”

Photographs of a child being lifted from the water evoked the wrenching images of a Syrian boy, Aylan Kurdi, whose body washed up on the Turkish coast last month, provoking global outrage and prompting European authorities to respond to the growing migrant crisis.

Even as European leaders met in Brussels again on Thursday to discuss the crisis, and pushed Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, dozens more continued to arrive. The Greek official said that the coast guard boat had been sent to collect arriving migrants, in what has become a daily routine. The accident occurred in relatively calm seas and the official, who asked for anonymity in keeping with government protocol, said the cause would be investigated.
