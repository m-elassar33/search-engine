Reporters in Lahti, about 60 miles north of the capital, Helsinki, recorded video of the bus being pelted with flares and smoke bombs as it arrived at a former army barracks being used as a reception center.

Journalists at the barracks noted that the first migrants off the bus were families with young children.

The words “Go home” were also scrawled on the pavement outside the barracks.

Before the bus arrived, the crowd of about three dozen protesters also threw rocks at Finnish Red Cross volunteers waiting to welcome the asylum seekers.

In another part of Finland, the police arrested a man for throwing a Molotov cocktail at an emergency shelter for migrants. No injuries were reported and the fire was extinguished.
