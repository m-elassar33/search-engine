For Britain, a withdrawal would have major implications, too, because it could lose automatic access to Europe’s single market, provoke economic uncertainty and leave the country more isolated internationally. Demands for a new referendum on Scottish independence could be triggered if the English vote differently from the more pro-European Scots.

On Saturday, Mr. Cameron lost no time in highlighting economic and other risks of a British withdrawal, which he called a “leap in the dark.”

Background on ‘Brexit’

Yet the referendum remains a gamble for Mr. Cameron, who has often sounded critical of the European Union in the past, but has now shifted to support a bloc that he admits he does not love. His tone became noticeably more pro-European after an agreement struck in Brussels on Friday giving concessions to Britain on a range of economic, sovereignty and welfare issues. His most senior allies, including, significantly, Theresa May, the home secretary, will support Mr. Cameron’s bid to stay inside the bloc.

Yet six cabinet ministers made it clear on Saturday that they will campaign for a British exit — known as Brexit.

The most significant of those is Michael Gove, the justice secretary and a personal friend of Mr. Cameron’s, whose decision personifies the fissures at the top of the Conservative Party.

But uncertainty surrounds the position of Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, whose support would be seen as a big asset by the “no” campaign because he is renowned as a communicator.

Mr. Johnson, long a Euroskeptic, has not yet made his views on withdrawal from the union clear, and his position is thought by many to be significant because the outcome of the referendum is hard to predict.

Meanwhile the two main groups campaigning for a British departure lack a convincing leader and are divided on tactics. One favors the argument that the European Union lacks democratic accountability, and that it stifles economic growth. A second group places more emphasis on immigration, and says that Britain can only fully regain control of this policy if it quits the bloc.

Supporters of European Union membership hope that Mr. Cameron’s status as an election-winning prime minister will prove decisive in the referendum campaign, which will be the first British plebiscite on Europe since 1975. Then, Britons voted by a clear margin to stay in what was called the European Economic Community, which they had joined in 1973.

Under pressure for the right of his own party, Mr. Cameron promised the referendum in 2013, but said he would renegotiate British ties to the bloc first. That effort culminated in an agreement in Brussels late Friday after more than 30 hours of talks.

Mr. Cameron argued that the deal was good enough to give Britain “the best of both worlds,” allowing the country to have the benefits of European Union membership while staying out of its single currency and passport-free travel zone. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, which wants to quit the bloc, dismissed Mr. Cameron’s agreement as “pathetic.”

While not the fundamental shift in the relationship that Mr. Cameron once seemed to promise, the agreement struck did give Britain some significant concessions and safeguards.

The talks proved tough because several of Mr. Cameron’s demands appeared to contradict fundamental European Union principles, including the right of all Europeans to live and work in any member states with equal treatment.

In the end, the deal gave Britain an exemption from a treaty obligation to pursue “ever closer union,” one of the bloc’s most important, if symbolic, pledges.

Mr. Cameron also won the right to restrict, for four years, welfare entitlements for citizens from other European Union countries who come to Britain to work. These include in-work benefits, which supplement the income of low-paid workers.

The deal also covered restrictions on child benefits, but Mr. Cameron had to compromise on what he had originally wanted.

Mr. Cameron also received safeguards to ensure that Britain’s financial sector would not face discrimination as a result of the fact that Britain did not join the euro currency, and kept the pound sterling.
