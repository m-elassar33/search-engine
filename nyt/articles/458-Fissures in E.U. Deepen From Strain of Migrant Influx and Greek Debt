The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, announced a series of proposals last month to deal with the crisis, including mandatory quotas to spread at least 40,000 migrants around Europe. It hailed the plan as proof that Europe could respond with unity and solidarity to a problem that has put huge strains on countries like Italy, Greece and Malta, which have taken most of the migrants fleeing conflict from North Africa.

But the plan, which is backed by Germany, immediately ran into fierce opposition from a number of countries, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, whose own citizens have flooded into wealthier nations in Western Europe to find work but where public opinion is strongly against taking in Arab and African migrants.

More than 50,000 migrants have arrived in Italy alone this year, according to Frontex, the European Union agency that helps protect the bloc’s borders. Most of them are stuck in legal limbo, awaiting word on whether they will be granted asylum or given other lawful status so they can settle and work.

Denmark has the right to opt out of European Union policy on immigration, as does Britain, but populist Danish politicians, nonetheless, seized on Brussels’ quota proposal before last week’s elections as an example of unacceptable meddling by the European Union in the sovereign affairs of member countries.

Unlike the Danish People’s Party, which has tried to curb more extremist voices, Slovakian anti-immigration groups that gathered here openly paraded their racism.

Speaking at the rally, Marian Kotleba, governor of a central Slovak region, wished protesters a “happy white day” and described the protest as an attempt to “save Slovakia” from the European quota program. “Even one immigrant is one too many,” said Mr. Kotleba, a founder of the People’s Party — Our Slovakia.

A Saudi family with a small child was attacked near the main rail station, and protesters destroyed at least six police cars, according to news reports.

Organizers said about 6,000 people took part in the protest, which disrupted a cycle race around Bratislava’s medieval castle. But local news reports estimated the crowd at 3,000 to 5,000 — still a large number by the standards of Slovakia, where street protests usually attract far fewer people. When a speaker asked protesters whether they would mind if he burned the European Union’s blue 12-star flag, the crowd shouted “No.” A flag was later set on fire.

While the protest was dominated by extremist groups, including a neo-Nazi one, mainstream politicians have also condemned the quota proposals.

At the security conference here on Friday, Robert Fico, the Slovak prime minister, said his country and its neighbors Hungary and Poland “refuse the principle” of mandatory quotas. He denounced the European Commission for what he called a “risky strategy” of trying to force countries to share in accepting migrants.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, who has clashed repeatedly with Brussels over issues like the death penalty and what critics say are his authoritarian ways, said every country had a duty to defend its own borders from unwanted outsiders, suggesting that Italy and Greece had failed to do so and should not now expect help from others.

“To defend borders is a national responsibility,” Mr. Orban said. “As a state, you have to protect your own borders. I don’t believe in a European solution.”

Hungary recently announced plans to build a 13-foot-high fence along its border with Serbia, which is not a member of the European Union but has become a transit point for migrants seeking to enter the bloc. Serbia has protested the fence plan and vowed to block it.

Worried that the proposed mandatory quota system for migrants is fast becoming an emblem of Europe’s divisions rather than action, European Union officials proposed last week that resettlement of migrants be done on a “voluntary mandatory” basis. It was unclear what this would mean in practice.

The confusion and passions stirred by the migrant issue have put a spotlight on how the domestic politics of individual European countries undermine Europe’s ability to take joint and decisive action. The same dynamic has also thwarted efforts to resolve the Greek debt crisis, with public opinion in Germany, Slovakia, Finland and many other nations strongly opposed to easing demands on Greece.

On Monday, European Union leaders are due to hold an emergency meeting to try to break the long-running deadlock over how to deal with Greece, which faces possible bankruptcy and default at the end of the month. The meeting will be followed on Thursday by another gathering to discuss the migrant crisis.

The migrant quota plan, which would force Slovakia to take about 700 migrants who landed in Italy and Greece, never had much chance of winning widespread approval, prompting criticism that the program from the start was largely a public relations exercise by the European Commission to create an illusion of action.

In a post on his Facebook page, Slovakia’s president, Andrej Kiska, voiced sympathy for countries facing the greatest influx.

“I repeat that there are no easy solutions to this problem,” he said. “But we can’t leave everything on the states that are hit the hardest. If we don’t start to cooperate, the European problem can become a global one. If we are not able to explain why we need to help people in need, we leave the space for the extremists. And we can’t let that happen.”
