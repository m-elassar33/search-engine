ISTANBUL — Since August 2014, 1,845 criminal cases have been opened against Turks for insulting their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a crime that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. Among the offenders are journalists, authors, politicians, a famous soccer star, even schoolchildren.

That number quantified a growing trend of cracking down on dissent, and was revealed this week by the country’s justice minister, Bekir Bozdag, in response to a question in Parliament.

“I don’t think you could read this without blushing,” Mr. Bozdag said late Tuesday, defending the myriad alleged insults subject to judicial scrutiny. “It is not an expression of opinion, it is all swears and insults.”

“Nobody should have the freedom to swear,” he added.

The crush of insult crimes that have inundated Turkey’s justice system reflect the president’s authoritarian leadership style, critics say, and his determination to not let any insult, perceived or otherwise, go unanswered.

They have also created bizarre legal scenarios. In one of the oddest cases, a doctor lost his job for creating a meme that compared Mr. Erdogan to Gollum, the creature from “The Lord of the Rings,” and a judge ordered expert testimony to determine whether Gollum was good or evil. Hakan Sukur, a beloved soccer star turned politician who was once a member of Mr. Erdogan’s party, has been targeted for posts on Twitter. A 13-year-old boy was charged after posting to Facebook, and a university student was pulled from class because of his social media posts. And a husband presented a recording of his wife, accused of insulting Mr. Erdogan while she watched him on television, to a prosecutor.
