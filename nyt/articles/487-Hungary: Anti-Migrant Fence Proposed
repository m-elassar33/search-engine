The government is considering building a 13-foot-high fence along the border with Serbia to stop the flow of migrants reaching the country, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Wednesday. Since the second half of 2014, the number of migrants and asylum seekers entering Hungary, mostly across the southern border with Serbia, has markedly risen. So far this year, more than 53,000 people have requested asylum. More than 70 percent over the past three months are from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, though the vast majority move farther west to destinations like Germany and Sweden shortly after filing their asylum requests.
