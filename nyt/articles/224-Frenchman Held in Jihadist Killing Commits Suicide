LONDON — A 35-year-old French deliveryman who beheaded his boss and then set off an explosion at an American-owned chemical plant near Lyon in June killed himself in his prison cell, officials said on Wednesday.

The man, Yassin Salhi, hanged himself on Tuesday evening in his cell in an isolation unit at a prison in the southern Paris suburb of Fleury-Mérogis, said Sylvaine Villeneuve, a spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry, in an email.

Mr. Salhi faced charges of murder, terrorism and involvement with Islamic State extremists, and on Tuesday morning, he was informed that his detention, scheduled to last until Jan. 4, would be extended by six months.

He had not been identified as a suicide risk, Ms. Villeneuve said.

The attack on June 26, nearly six months after an attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in Paris, further unnerved France. It occurred on the same day that Islamist extremists killed dozens of people at a hotel in Sousse, Tunisia, and at a mosque in Kuwait.

Mr. Salhi, who lived in a suburb of Lyon, in southeastern France, lured his boss, Hervé Cornara, 54, into the back of a utility truck, knocked him unconscious with a car jack, and strangled him, the French authorities said.
