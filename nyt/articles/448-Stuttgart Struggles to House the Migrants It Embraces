“The percentage of entrepreneurs in Stuttgart with migrant backgrounds is the highest in Germany,” Mr. Gunes, who teaches at Stuttgart University and is the son of Turkish migrants himself, elaborated over börek and yogurt at the bakery.

“We’re talking I.T. people, engineers, architects, artists,” he said. “You only see the greengrocer and the butcher at street level, not all the doctors and lawyers upstairs.”

Stuttgart’s big move was to avoid pushing migrants into poor, isolated suburbs as in Rome or Paris, he emphasized.

“The layout of the city has reinforced integration,” he said.

One can see what he means by what’s not here. Stuttgart doesn’t have ethnic enclaves. After World War II, Mercedes and Bosch erected hostels for guest workers. But by the 1970s, when Manfred Rommel became mayor, political and business leaders adopted a different tack, integrating migrants into existing communities in the city center. Stuttgart embraced a melting pot urbanism.

Wilfried Porth, a member of the Daimler board and director of the company’s labor relations, recalls Stuttgart as a dour place years ago.

“Then Italians and Spaniards and Turks brought cafe life to the streets,” he said. “Physically, tangibly, this became a much friendlier, more open city.”

According to Mr. Porth, Daimler is now underwriting language training, job apprenticeships, and access to sports and other clubs so critical to the social fabric in Germany — helping a wider effort to speed up the process of integration for new migrants. The hope is to avoid the mistake that West German and other European cities have made, enabling a kind of parallel culture of alienated guest workers to occupy isolated pockets of cities.

“We need, as quickly as possible, to integrate refugees into neighborhoods and provide them with skills and the capability to afford housing here,” Mr. Porth said.

That said, Daimler is not in the housing business, and Stuttgart, like Berlin, New York, London and Paris, faces a housing shortage.

City leaders want to fight sprawl, but sky-high construction costs, Europe-wide environmental regulations that discourage tall buildings, an inviolable green belt around the city center and little land in public hands all make building new apartments here a struggle.

Maybe the biggest long-term hurdle, though, is that Stuttgart needs new thinking about the shape and mix of its apartments.

A disproportionate amount of new housing across the country is built for nuclear families, but according to the German Federal Institute of Demography, more than half of German city dwellers live alone. In “Living Complex,” Niklas Maak, an author and architecture critic for The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, points out that nuclear families today account for only 14 percent to 20 percent of households in big German cities like Berlin and Munich — “almost a marginal group,” he notes, and yet “this social development is hardly reflected in housing policies.”

“The forms of housing offered to the residents of a city have less and less to do with the life that takes place in them,” Mr. Maak concludes. The influx of Muslim migrants who will want housing for extended families tips the scales even further out of whack.

Christine Tritschler is a young urban planner in Stuttgart. “It’s a crisis the refugees don’t create but make more acute,” she said. “There hasn’t been nearly enough thinking about new housing types. More and more people want to live in the city center — workers, students, families, older people — in ways that current housing strategies don’t address.”

The issue isn’t unique to Stuttgart. After reunification, Berlin’s housing glut made that city a magnet for young people. A bounty of big, cheap apartments propelled Berlin’s culture scene, but this accelerated gentrification. City officials failed to notice when the housing surplus became a deficit. Now Berlin’s leaders are scrambling to provide 6,000 or more new affordable units a year. But what kind?

A couple of recent housing projects by young architects there rethink the economics and configurations of apartment buildings. The designers — Ifau and Jesko Fezer, Heide & Von Beckerath — recently completed a six-story block called R50, with timber facade and wraparound balconies: a low-cost communal development that stressed shared spaces and flexible units. At the moment, Syrian refugees are occupying some of those shared spaces.

The other project, called Spreefeld, is the work of a team of firms, Carpaneto, Fatkoehl and BAR. It mixes communal living with commercial and nonprofit offices, public green space and ground-floor common rooms. Refugees have found a haven in Spreefeld, too. The goal of the developer, Christian Schöning, is an affordable, adaptable, collaborative housing model, built in consultation with the neighborhood. It costs less per square foot to construct than what Berlin officials say is the city’s least expensive new public housing. Just as important, the flexible, communal housing provides a potential model for a growing population of Muslim migrants with extended families who don’t fit the nuclear model.

“We have to start thinking ahead 10 to 20 years,” Mr. Schöning said. “We can’t only focus on the immediate crisis, because the population is changing the way we live, and this is a long-term issue.”

In Stuttgart, Isabel Fezer, a deputy mayor, echoed the thought: “Social and urban challenges go together,” she said. “In this city, we have lots of practice integrating people and have had few migrant-specific troubles as a result, but if we can’t house everybody, then we will have social problems. Housing is the No. 1 issue.”

“The migrants are a challenge and an opportunity,” she added. “At this point, they’re both. But they are here to stay.

“So we must make sure this becomes an opportunity, because it is our future.”
